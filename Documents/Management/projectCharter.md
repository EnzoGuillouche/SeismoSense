## Project Overview

This project would deal with developing a cutting-edge earthquake simulation tool designed to test the structural resilience of buildings and other infrastructure under various seismic scenarios.

## Project Goals

I would want to perform few goals with this project:

- Simulate earthquakes effectively and in a realistic way.
- Create a user-friendly interface to set easily earthquakes' parameters.
- Export detailed analysis reports of the simulated disasters.

## Deliverables and Milestones

### Deliverables

I have to complete the following deliverables :

- Functional Specifications
- Technical Specifications
- Test Plan
- User Manual
- Source Code
- Unit Tests
- Weekly Reports and Management Planning

### Milestones

Here are the milestones according to the deliverables:

| Deliverable | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Functional Specifications | A document that describes the what I am going to build and the expected behavior of the simulation tool. |
| Technical Specifications | A document that describes the technical requirements and how the simulation tool should be created. |
| Test Plan | A document that describes the test strategy and the test cases that will be used to validate the simulation tool. |
| User Manual | A document that describes how to use the simulation tool. |
| Source Code | The source code of the simulation tool. |

## Resources and Constraints

### Resources

- **GitHub**: Inspiring from other projects (related to this one or not) could be useful to perform the project.
- **Online resources**: Specific physics and dynamics are needed to be learned to perform the project.

### Constraints

- **Simulation creation**: A strict simulation of a natural disaster is quite tough to create.
- **Development Time**: The project has to be performed in the mean time of my studies at ALGOSUP, meaning that I need to manage my time efficiently to complete all deliverables on schedule.

## Overall plan

To ensure the success of the project, I will follow the following plan:

1. I will start by understanding the target audience's needs and the current state of the project.
2. I will define the most important features to develop and will write the functional and technical specifications.
3. I will develop the software, write the test plan and the user manual.
4. Each time some code is written, I will write unit tests and will add the bugs to the project's issues.
5. I will write weekly reports and management planning to keep track of the project's progress.
