# SeismoSense

---

## Overview

This project would deal with developing a cutting-edge earthquake simulation tool designed to test the structural resilience of buildings and other infrastructure under various seismic scenarios. 
Built with C++ and OpenGL, this project focuses on real-time visualization and precise simulation of seismic impacts, empowering engineers, researchers, and urban planners to better prepare for and mitigate earthquake risks.

## Features

- **Seismic Event Simulation**: Generate realistic earthquake scenarios with customizable parameters (magnitude, epicenter, depth, ground type).  
- **Structural Analysis**: Simulate and visualize the deformation and stress of infrastructure models in real-time.  
- **Soil-Structure Interaction**: Analyze how different soil types influence structural behavior during seismic activity.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive controls to adjust parameters and view results through dynamic visualizations.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Export detailed analysis reports, including maximum stress levels, safety margins, and estimated damage.
